    "[**To be written last, after finalizing all other sections.**  This section should summarize the key aspects of your System Proposal Draft.  It should briefly cover:]\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose of the System:**  What problem does the Cowboy Hotel Conference Room Booking System solve? What are its main goals?\n",
    "*   **Key Requirements:** Briefly mention the core functional and non-functional requirements.\n",
    "*   **Feasibility Assessment:** Summarize the findings of your technical, economic, and organizational feasibility analysis.  Is the project feasible?\n",
    "*   **Project Plan:**  Mention the project phases and timeline.  Are you on track?\n",
    "*   **Process and Data Models:**  Indicate that process models (DFDs) and a data model (E-R Diagram) have been developed to visualize and define the system. Acknowledge any sections that are still under development (like Level 1 DFDs for all processes).\n",
    "*   **Overall Readiness:**  Conclude by stating that the system proposal draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the project requirements and that the team is ready to move into the design phase.\n",

    "> This System Proposal Draft outlines a plan for the development of a new Conference Room Booking System for the Cowboy Hotel. The current manual booking process is inefficient and error-prone, leading to lost revenue and operational challenges.  The proposed system aims to automate and streamline conference room bookings, improve efficiency, and enhance revenue potential.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Key functional requirements include managing conference room bookings, processing payments (tracking), handling room availability and scheduling, and generating reports for management.  Non-functional requirements emphasize operational compatibility, performance, and security.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A feasibility analysis indicates that the project is technically feasible using readily available technologies, economically viable with a strong projected return on investment, and organizationally aligned with the hotel's needs and strategic goals.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A project work plan has been developed outlining the project phases and timeline.  The project is currently in the Analysis phase.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Preliminary process models (Data Flow Diagrams) and a data model (Entity-Relationship Diagram) have been created to visualize the system's processes and data structure. Level 1 DFDs for all Level 0 processes are under development for the final deliverable.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This draft system proposal demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the project requirements and a well-defined plan for system development.  The project team is prepared to proceed to the Design phase based on the progress made and documented in this proposal.\n",

    "### Technical Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The project team assesses the proposed Cowboy Hotel Conference Room Booking System to be technically feasible. System requirements specifying compatibility with existing and future hardware (Windows 11 and Office Professional 2014) indicate the use of standard and readily available technologies. The team intends for the system to be a standalone application, separate from the existing hotel room booking software, which simplifies integration complexities. While ensuring a user-friendly interface accessible to multiple staff members with varying technical skills is a common challenge in software development, the team believes it can be addressed through careful design and user testing. The project's emphasis on simplicity and ease of use further reinforces a technically straightforward and manageable solution for the hotel staff.  The planned addition of two computers effectively addresses current hardware limitations, making system deployment technically viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Economic Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The project team's analysis demonstrates strong economic feasibility for the Cowboy Hotel Conference Room Booking System, as evidenced by the provided cost-benefit analysis. The analysis projects significant net benefits of **$402,000** over the first three years of operation, with a positive cumulative cash flow.  The team expects the system to generate substantial increased revenue of **$420,000** from conference room bookings over three years and cost savings of **$60,000** through reduced labor and booking errors over the same period. The total development cost is estimated at **$56,000**, aligning with the development budget cap. Operational costs, including hardware, software licenses, and training, are relatively low compared to the projected benefits.  The team concludes that the clear return on investment indicated by the positive net benefits and cash flow strongly supports the economic viability of this project, making it a worthwhile investment for the Cowboy Hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organizational Feasibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The team's evaluation indicates strong organizational feasibility for the Cowboy Hotel Conference Room Booking System. Project sponsorship by Jaime Bradson, the Hotel Manager, demonstrates clear management support and alignment with the hotel's strategic goals. The stated business need directly addresses operational inefficiencies and revenue limitations within the hotel's conference room booking process, highlighting a clear organizational problem that the project solves. The system requirements consider the needs of hotel staff by emphasizing a user-friendly interface and ease of use, crucial for successful adoption and minimizing resistance to change. Furthermore, the urgency stemming from current manual processes causing inefficiencies underscores the organizational readiness and need for swift system implementation. The focus on simplicity and minimal technical training for staff also aligns with the organizational context, ensuring a smooth transition and integration of the new system into hotel operations.\n",

    "\"2.0 Check Room Availability\"\n",

    "* **Room DB:** Stores conference room information (availability, capacity, features, pricing).\n",
    "* **Payment DB:** Stores payment information related to bookings.\n",
